A Material UI redesign for [FrancoYudica's GenArt](https://github.com/FrancoYudica/Genart).

I did not add any new features or fixed any major bugs; Rather, I focused on creating a consistent style, quality-of-life improvements, and generally a better UI/UX experience.

## Features  

- **A consistant color pallete and a fresh coat of paint using Material UI assets and principles**
- Reorganized the top banner, including organically emphasizing the start/stop buttons and added a stopwatch/iteration counter when generating an image
- Added a "clear all" button to the texture groups container
- Every panel and window can be quickly closed by hitting "ESC"
- Clairified some settings and added more tooltips
